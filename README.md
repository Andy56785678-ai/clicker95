# clicker95
A clicker game based off Windows 95, made by Gemini 3.0. 1.0.0 comes with Clicker 95, Clicker 98, and Clicker 3.1.

# HUGE NOTE
All this is made by Gemini 3.0! None of the code is made by me.

This rep has all versions of Clicker 95 as an .html file, so any computer with a modern browser can run it. It uses vanilla JS and HTML.

# How to play
All you have to do is go to the version you want to play, then press the "Raw" download button, then run it in your browser!
